# student-directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled
at Villains Academy. What does it mean to get expelled from Villains Academy?
Are you a bad villain or a good person if they chuck you out? The students
directory script won't tell you that, but it's interesting to think about
anyway.
